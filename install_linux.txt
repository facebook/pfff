To build pfff, you will require several developpement packages usually
not shipped in a default install.

Install pcre-devel, gtk2-devel, atk-devel, pango-devel, and cairo-devel,
swi-prolog, binutils-gold.

For instance:
for RedHat: sudo yum install pcre-devel
for Gentoo: sudo emerge pcre
for Arch: I don't remember

For Ubuntu/Debian, packages are named differently, usually with a 'lib'
prefix, you will want to install:
libpcre3-dev, libgtk2.0-dev, libcairo2-dev, libpango1.0-dev and finally
the binutils-goldl package.

On Fedora you may need to install the camlp4 packages too: 
 ocaml-camlp4 ocaml-camlp4-devel

Then:
  $ ./configure
  $ make depend
  $ make
  $ make opt
