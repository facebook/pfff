(* Purpose *)
(*****************************************************************************)
(* 
 * This is the main entry point of codegraph, a package/module/type/function/...
 * hierarchical dependency visualizer using mainly a Dependency
 * Structure Matrix (DSM). This should help understand the "software
 * architecture" of a project and assist in refactoring it.
 * A node-link display of hierarchical graphs (or hypergraphs) would be nice
 * too, but it is far more complex to draw than matrices and does
 * not scale as well visually apparently.
 * See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_structure_matrix
 * A great introduction on the use of DSM for improving a codebase is
 * http://codebetter.com/patricksmacchia/2009/08/24/identify-code-structure-patterns-at-a-glance/
 * 
 * 
 * It seems there are a few commercial projects using DSM (Ndepend,
 * Structure101, Intellij), so this looks like a viable direction to pursue
 * to visualize a software architecture.
 * 
 * requirements:
 *  - different granularities for x-to-x relationships
 *    (packages to packages, modules to packages, functions, constructors, etc),
 *    so one can get:
 *    * package (or directory) projection to reduce the size of the graph and
 *      get a high-level view of the architecture ("package mode")
 *    * with or without external/ dependencies
 *    * possibiltiy to get a slice of the graph for just a directory
 *      with a package (or directory) projection for external dependencies
 *      ("module mode")
 *    * possiblity to zoom to see the actual functions of a package involved
 *      in a dependency. This is especially useful for edges where
 *      we don't understand why there exists a dependency.
 *  - variable arrow size (but the count number in the matrix does that too)
 *  - variable node size (but the count number in same row does that too)
 * 
 * This tool also contains some actions to generate data for different
 * graph visualizer, e.g. Gephi, Guess. todo? backend for Graphviz? Phylomel?
 * old: $ pm_depend [-lang X] [-with-extern] [-depth n] -o filename /path/dir
 *

 * 
 *  - a few visualizations applied on go dependencies (including chords)
 *    http://dave.cheney.net/2014/11/21/visualising-dependencies
 * 
 * - google search images: dependency+graph+visualization, get many
 *   links from there 
 * 
 * 
 * history:
 *  - quick look at work on software architecture because of Banatre
 *    while a master student at IRISA, and later Schmidt, while a PhD,
 *    looking at work of Shaw and Garlan and the different
 *    architecture patterns (whiteboard, pipe, layers, etc).
 *  - started to draw hypergraphs of architecture while supervising a
 *    student project at EMN (submarine game), and advocated they were
 *    better than UML diagrams (I think after reading Harel's papers on
 *    history of statecharts in HOPL-III)
 *  - dir to dir dependencies during coccinelle project? 
 *    Projections were hardcoded each time for each use. 
 *    No generic framework (like the hierarchical dependency matrix).
 *    Done for C (then for PHP later, and then for OCaml far later).
 *  - very nice picture of architecture of Linux kernel sent by Gilles,
 *    the "map of the Linux kernel"
 *  - found that having a graph of module dependencies was very useful
 *    when refactored the c-- and mmm codebase, thx to ocamldot.
 *    But felt the need to have variable-size arrows (and nodes) and also
 *    the ability to get more information when clicking on an edge, 
 *    to actually see what are the functions involved in a dependency
 *    for instance.
 *  - flibotonomy by Greg Scheschte for PHP, but focused on the nodes
 *    instead of the edges (which I think are more important).
 *  - overlay, and cmf -y to display dependencies at "package" level
 *  - pm_depend, ocaml dependencies backend, ~package_depth, ~with_extern.
 *    In some ways it extracts the dependency information I have 
 *    in my Makefiles where I care about the order of the directories
 *    and files. The ~package_depth and ~with_extern parameters are just
 *    special cases of the general idea of displaying at different
 *    granularity dependencies depending on the directory.
 *    Finally it was limited to just package/module (pm_depend) but quickly
 *    you want to know the actual functions/classes that are involved in
 *    a dependency.
 *  - gephi/guess visualization, but even with -no_extern, it does not
 *    scale very well for www. It's ok for pfff, but even for 
 *    the full source of pfff the graph is quite noisy.
 *  - discover DSM of ndepend.com while doing a google search images on
 *    "dependency+graph+visualization"
 * 
 *  - gradually realize the importance of layered structures
 *    (which are actually enforced in OCaml by the linker)
 *  - gradually realize the importance of dependencies and how
 *    they are at the essence of software architecture. Code is
 *    a tree when looked locally (AST), but it's really a graph
 *    of dependencies when looked globally.
 * 
 * todo: 
 *  - can codegraph does a good job to convey the software architecture
 *    of codegraph itself? does it show clearly that Graph_code.graph and
 *    dependencies_matrix_code.dm are the essential data structures? And
 *    can it show the important fields?
 *  - maybe edge-bundles could make the node-link display approach
 *    scale better.
 *  - generate a node-link graph for the current matrix configuration; use
 *    graphviz as a first step.
 *  - http://redotheweb.com/DependencyWheel/?
 * 
 * 
 * (comments that were in graph_modules_packages_ml.ml)
 * alternatives:
 *  - ocamldoc -dot ...
 *    But if there is one parse error or a module not found, then 
 *    ocamldoc fails. Also there is no package "projection" so it's 
 *    hard to apply on large projects. There is also no with-extern view
 *    with the slice of the graph to a directory.
 *    TODO it can potentially support more code though, by using camlp4.
 *  - ocamldoc with graphviz  
 *    graphviz does not do variable node size for free as in gephi
 *  - ocamldoc -dot-reduce ... 
 *    The -dot-reduce is good for layering, but sometimes
 *    it's also good to see things without the reduction (especially
 *    with gephi). See for instance the graph for tiger with ocamldoc
 *    vs pm_depend. I can see all the real callers to option.ml.
 *    TODO the reduce and layering is also useful
 *  - ocamldoc -dot-colors
 *    TODO this is useful.
 *    It's somehow covered by the strongly-connected + coloring in gephi.
 *  - graphviz backend? graphviz is good for layers, but
 *    you lose space because the high-level stuff is at the top but alone.
 *    With gephi/fatlas, by putting high-level stuff at the center, 
 *    you lose less space? Also graphviz does not scale very well.
